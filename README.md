## Motivation

I embarked on this project due to the difficulty I faced in finding a suitable home in San Francisco. Given the high rental prices and varying neighborhood characteristics, I used my data science skills to create a recommendation system to help streamline the process.

- **Location-based Filtering**: Filters listings based on user preferences for location, price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes social media comments and reviews to gauge neighborhood safety, convenience, and public transport availability.
