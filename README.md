# San Francisco Smart HomeFinder

This project aims to solve the challenge of finding a suitable rental property in San Francisco by leveraging data science and machine learning techniques. The Virtual Housing Agent provides users with personalized recommendations based on their preferences, and displays results on an interactive map.



## Motivation

I embarked on this project due to the difficulty I faced in finding a suitable home in San Francisco. Given the high rental prices and varying neighborhood characteristics, I used my data science skills to create a recommendation system to help streamline the process.



## Features

- **Real-time Rental Data**: Fetches data from Rental Listings API to provide up-to-date rental listings.
- **Location-based Filtering**: Filters listings based on user preferences for location, price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes social media comments and reviews to gauge neighborhood safety, convenience, and public transport availability.
- **Interactive Map**: Displays recommended properties on a map for easy visualization.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides a smooth user experience with an intuitive interface.
